Below is a Python function that counts from 1 to 100, skipping every `M`th and `N`th multiple:\n\n```python\ndef count_with_skips(M, N):\n    for i in range(1, 101):\n        if i % M != 0 and i % N != 0:\n            print(i)\n\n# Example usage:\ncount_with_skips(3, 5)\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `M` and `N` are the multiples you want to skip.\n- The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to 100.\n- For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is not divisible by `M` or `N`.\n- If the condition is met, it prints the number.\n\nYou can call the function with different values of `M` and `N` to see how many numbers get printed. For example, calling `count_with_skips(3, 5)` will skip multiples of both 3 and 5.","refusal":null,"annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":[],"reasoning_content":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop","stop_reason":null,"token_ids":null}],"service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"prompt_tokens":65,"total_tokens":280,"completion_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":null},"prompt_logprobs":null,"prompt_token_ids":null,"kv_transfer_params":null}
