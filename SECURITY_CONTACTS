# Security Contacts

# Defined below are the security contacts for this repo.
# They are the contact point for security-related issues and vulnerabilities.
#
# As this project is derived from a Kubernetes project, we maintain similar 
# security practices while adapting them for our specific needs.

# DO NOT REPORT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES THROUGH PUBLIC GITHUB ISSUES.
# Instead, please report them via:
# 1. Email to the contacts below
# 2. GitHub's security advisory feature: https://github.com/elevated-systems/compute-gardener-scheduler/security/advisories/new
